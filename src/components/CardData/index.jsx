        Plant your first tree in the crypto world with a Node Tree and see the
        fruits of your labor manifest. When you mint a Node Tree you can expect
        to see a return of ethereum in your wallet once a week/month. These
        returns on your nft come from taking your cost of minting and pooling it
        with funds from other owners of nfts and creating validator nodes on
        networks that offer a reward for validating.
      </p>

      <p>
        These returns are like the fruit growing on a tree. The returns start
        small and slowly ramp up as we adjust payout vs restaking percentages.
        The first couple months you can expect a smaller return but when the
        payout percentage is increased you will start to see that making passive
        income is truly possible. You might ask why buying our nft is worth 0.1
        eth and why you shouldn't just take that 0.1 and stake it on your own.
